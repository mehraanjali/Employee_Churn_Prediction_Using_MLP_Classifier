# Employee Churn Prediction Using MLP Classifier

## Description:

Employee retention is a critical challenge for organizations. High employee turnover can be costly and disruptive. This GitHub project aims to address this issue by developing a machine learning model that predicts employee churn. The project utilizes a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier to analyze various employee-related features and make predictions about whether an employee is likely to leave the company.

## Components:

Data Exploration:

The project begins with data exploration and analysis of an HR dataset sourced from Kaggle. Key employee features such as satisfaction level, last evaluation, number of projects, average monthly hours, time spent at the company, work accidents, promotions in the last 5 years, department, and salary are examined.
Data Preprocessing:

Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (e.g., department and salary), and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Building:

A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier is implemented using scikit-learn.
The model is trained on the training dataset to learn patterns and relationships between employee features and their likelihood of leaving the company.
Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Visualizations, such as a confusion matrix, may be created to provide insights into the model's predictions.

## Results:

The project delivers a predictive model capable of identifying employees at risk of leaving the company.
Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance.
